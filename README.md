Project Overview

In this project, my team and I conducted a comprehensive analysis of four prospective clients' asset portfolios selected by using random sampling from our database. We focused on providing detailed insights and recommendations based on the most recent 12-month (12M), 18-month (18M), and 24-month (24M) returns for each securities house and the entire portfolio of each client.

Analysis and Findings

Return Analysis: We meticulously calculated and analyzed the returns for the most recent 12M, 18M, and 24M periods for each securities house. This helped us understand the performance trends and identify any significant patterns or anomalies.

Risk Assessment: For each portfolio, we determined the 12M sigma (risk), offering a clear picture of the volatility and risk levels associated with the clients' investments.

Correlation Insights: Our analysis revealed interesting correlations within the portfolios, allowing us to understand the relationships between different securities and their impact on overall performance.

Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we provided tailored recommendations for each client, focusing on:

Portfolio Optimization: Suggestions on which holdings to add to enhance the portfolioâ€™s performance.
Risk and Return Adjustments: Detailed projections on how the portfolio risk and expected returns will change after rebalancing, including the addition of new securities.
Conclusion
Our detailed analysis and insights enable clients to make informed decisions about their asset portfolios. By identifying key areas for improvement and potential risks, we help optimize their investment strategies for better returns and lower risk.
