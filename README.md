Project Overview

I analyzed the performance of four prospective clients’ asset portfolios. I selected these clients using random sampling from an investment database and focused on their portfolio returns over the past 12 months (12M), 18 months (18M), and 24 months (24M). By breaking down each portfolio’s returns and risk profile, I helped pinpoint opportunities for higher gains and minimized risk.

My Role & Technical Contributions

Data Gathering and Cleanup

I used Python to connect to the internal database, retrieving raw data for each client’s current holdings. In the process, I handled missing values and merged separate datasets—from market indices to specific securities—into one cohesive data source.

Return Calculations

With Python libraries like pandas and NumPy, I calculated the annualized returns for each period (12M, 18M, 24M). By centralizing the calculation scripts, I ensured consistency and accuracy across all four client portfolios.

Risk Assessment (Sigma)

I determined the standard deviation (sigma) for each portfolio over a 12-month window to gauge volatility. This statistical measure helped to see how much each portfolio’s returns could swing over time.

Correlation Analysis & Modeling
Using correlation matrices, I examined relationships between different assets in each portfolio. This step helped me see which securities moved together and which behaved independently. I also tested regression models to uncover how certain holdings could affect overall returns and risk.

Forecasting & Scenario Evaluation

To give clients a glimpse into future performance, I developed forecasting scripts based on historical data and key market indicators. This made it possible to evaluate how changes in market conditions might affect portfolio returns.

Portfolio Optimization

Drawing on Modern Portfolio Theory, I ran simulations in Python such as Monte Carlo analyses to see how adding or removing holdings would affect expected returns and volatility. This approach highlighted the best rebalancing strategies for each client’s goals and risk tolerance.
Key Insights & Recommendations

Return Patterns

By comparing the 12M, 18M, and 24M performance of different securities, I uncovered which investments were consistently outperforming and which were lagging.

Risk Levels

I provided a clear snapshot of each portfolio’s volatility through the 12M sigma values. Clients could see exactly how much risk they were taking on and whether that risk aligned with their investment strategy.

Diversification Opportunities

The correlation analysis showed where portfolios could benefit from more diversification. For instance, if certain assets were highly correlated, it meant the client might consider balancing their portfolio to spread out potential risks.

Actionable Investment Strategies

I proposed tailored solutions for each client, suggesting which securities to add to improve returns and reduce risk. Using the forecasting data, I also demonstrated the expected change in each portfolio’s performance after rebalancing.

Conclusion

Ultimately, I helped translate raw financial data into clear, actionable advice for these four clients. By using Python for data engineering, return and risk analysis, modeling, and forecasting, I could deliver recommendations that were both precise and easy to understand. This project not only guided clients toward better performance and lower volatility but also underscored how a data-driven approach can optimize asset portfolios in a fast-changing market.
